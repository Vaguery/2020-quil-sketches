# 2020 `quil` sketches

Trying to do a relatively simple `quil` sketch as often as I can manage. Days of the project are in branches, with the master being the first day.

## Usage

Run `lein figwheel` in your terminal. Wait for a while until you see `Successfully compiled "resources/public/js/main.js"`. Open [localhost:3449](http://localhost:3449) in your browser.

You can use this while developing your sketch. Whenever you save your source files the browser will automatically refresh everything, providing you with quick feedback. For more information about Figwheel, check the [Figwheel repository on GitHub](https://github.com/bhauman/lein-figwheel).

## Publishing a sketch

Before you publish your sketch, edit `resources/public/index.html` and `project.clj` to change the name of the compiled optimized javascript generated for the branch you're in. Or not. Up to you. Then run `lein do clean, cljsbuild once optimized`. This will compile your code and run Google Closure Compiler with advanced optimizations. Take `resources/public/index.html` and `resources/public/js/main.js` and upload them to server of your choice.
